            I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer with five years of experience, dedicated to crafting innovative and impactful solutions. <br/><br/>

            My coding journey began when I was 16 in high school, where I spent three years mastering development fundamentals. This foundation paved the way for my service in the IDF's elite computer unit, SHAHAR, where I advanced my skills by developing critical systems for the army while pursuing personal projects over the past three years.<br/><br/>

            With a deep enthusiasm for Full-Stack development, I thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments that encourage creativity and innovation. Problem-solving and continuous learning drive my work, and I am always eager to tackle new challenges that refine my expertise.<br/><br/>

            I am committed to delivering exceptional results and contributing meaningfully to forward-thinking teams, ensuring the projects I work on have a lasting impact.<br/><br/>
